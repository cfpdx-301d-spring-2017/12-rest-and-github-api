#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Anwar and Meryl paired together. It took about 3 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on repo.js and repoView.js and added our github token in its own file.
  2. Next, we retrieved the repo data from Github API.
  3. Next, we filled out our Handlebars template with the appropriate properties from each repo object.
  4. Next, we took on the stretch goal of gathering user data from the Github API and added that to the About section.
